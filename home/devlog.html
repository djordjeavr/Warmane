        <p>The warmane developers are currently working on a few things:</p>
        <br>
        <p>- Holiday events. Our script team is currently working on some special events which we have planned. They will show something never seen before in this game and will surely give a lot of laughs and cries. More info will follow soon on our forums.</p>
        <br>
        <p>- Replay system. While we aren't yet sure if this is going to hit our live realms, we have a working internal version of a Replay system ported over from the old Blackrock core. It is however not easy to make it crossrealm compatible thus we cannot make promises yet.</p>
        <br>
        <p>- External instance hosting. Moving instances away from the main Worldservers, it will further increase realm stability and decrease the potential lagging during peak times (especially on icecrown).</p>
       <br>
       <p>- Focus on stability continues, we are now consistently seeing 7 day uptimes across all our services. We are restarting the realms once a week for maintainance and updates.</p>
       <br>
       <p>This are just a small part of what the team is working on. We hope to show you some results on our realms soon!</p>

        <p>October 9, 2019</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-mein">
        <p>We have been improving our anticheat lately, while no specifics will be given. We wish to inform players that we will no longer allow edits of maps. We have been logging terrain edits for quite a while and have seen a number of players having these altered, some giving an unfair advantage. Starting this week we will move these checks from logging only to kicking so everyone can get rid of these illicit client modifications.</p>

        <p class="txt">Focus</p>
        <p>September 13, 2019</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-mein">
       <p>There are currently multiple projects running on which the Warmane team is working. First of all we are looking into refining the leveling experience on MoP, working up from the lower level zones. Itâ€™s a big task which has to be done separately for our MoP realm as the 'old world' is completely different from the other expansions we offer.</p>
       <br>
       <p>We are also putting focus on our realm stability. Over time a few coding errors have sneaked in which can cause realm instability. It is very hard to find these, but we have had a 7-day uptime on Icecrown a few days ago. We are still looking to improve this. The situation we want to create is one where only the gamemaster or development team restarts the server when its needed for maintenance, which is usually once per week.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Another small thing to note is that we have recently updated our algorithm which assembles the "lower gear" battleground bracket. We were starting to see a lot of twinks which basically destroys the situation we are trying to create. The algorithm will now separate players better and twinking will now be harder to do so. We will continue to monitor the situation and make more changes if need be.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Lastly, we have upped our game against botting, the chances of being caught are greatly increased due to new detection methods, If you get caught with any kind of bot you will get a permanent ban.</p>

    <p class="txt">Low level zones and more</p>
    <p>July 4, 2019</p>
</div>
<div class="content-mein">
    <p>The Warmane team has been putting quite some time into improving our low-level zones. Every character will have to go through this content one way or another, thus it must be as perfect as can be. We reworked scripts and abilities to over thousands of mobs so far and we will continue until we have touched every single mob in-game. These improvements will be across the board for our TBC and WoTLK realms since they both share the same creatures in these zones.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Frostwolf will also be getting a bunch of mid-level zone updates as we are fully porting Outland and Northrend in addition to many low level instances across all continents.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We have also improved our tracking of quests which will better help us understand which quests a have a low completion and/or high abandonment rate. We will use this data to find out which quests have potential issues.</p>
    <br>
    <p>On a more technical note, we are reworking the back-end of player movement. Currently, the implementation isn't very latency friendly. When this is done, there will be much less warping/jitter going on when observing high latency players.

        For the programmers amongst us, we are implementing propper handling of 'movement ACKs'.</p>

<p class="txt">Warmane is Worldwide</p>
<p>March 8, 2019</p>
</div>
<div class="content-mein">
<p>Over the past couple of days we have been improving the experience for non-English players using non-English clients.</p>
<br>
<p>If you are one of these players you have surely noticed that spell, item, achievement and more links are now automatically translated to whichever language client you are using. For now, this feature is only on our WoTLK realms untill we feel confident enough to port it to our other expansions. We have also fixed an issue where Russian and Asian clients would have to edit their config files in order to change realms. This was caused because their client did not allow picking an Engish realm at Realm selection.</p>
<br>
<p>If there is more issues which only occur on non-English clients. Please let us know in the bug tracker.</p>
<br>
<p>Update: This feature is now ported to our TBC realm aswell.</p>

<p>August 23, 2018</p>
</div>
<div class="content-mein">
<p>We are fully reworking the Death Knight starting zone. As this is written the final changes are being made and very soon it will all be tested internally. After this we will focus our WOTLK efforts towards vanilla zones and quests. While most of it is already in good shape, there are a few things that could get improved and we rely heavily on the bug tracker and player reports to find these.</p>
